# üöÄ AWS Face Recognition Pipeline

Welcome to the AWS Face Recognition repository! This project focuses on building a serverless face recognition pipeline on AWS using various cloud services such as EC2, Lambda, S3, SQS, and auto-scaling. This pipeline incorporates the power of cloud computing to efficiently and effectively recognize faces using cutting-edge technology.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is structured to provide a detailed implementation of the face recognition pipeline on AWS. Here is a breakdown of the main components:

- **Dockerfile:** Contains the Docker configuration for running the face recognition application in a containerized environment.
- **Java:** Includes Java code snippets for specific functionalities within the face recognition pipeline.
- **Python:** Contains Python scripts for managing and processing face recognition tasks.
- **AWS Services:** Configuration files and code snippets for integrating with EC2, Lambda, S3, and SQS services on AWS.
